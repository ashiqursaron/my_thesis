This code tries different downsampling approaches to yeild better performances from the system.

1. Farthest Point Sampling (FPS)
2. Voxel/Grid Downsampling

Work Update: We built the full architecture for Silent Speech Recognition system.

Remaining Work: We want to implement 2 downsampling techniques to remove a major bottleneck issue that we faced where huge data is lost (30000 points to 1024 points) to improve performance
